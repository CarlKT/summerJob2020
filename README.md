The goal of this project was applying various neural networks to study gene expression.
The main product from the research is a variational autoencoder using crucially a gumbel-softmax activation,
in order to have a approximated discrete output.

Unfourtunately, I do not currently have access to the jupyter notebook containing the bulk of my work, but as soon as I do, it will be here.
