The goal of this project was applying various neural networks to study gene expression.
For more information, see grants (in particular, NSERC_Fonseca_Gregory_Proposal.docx).

The main product from the research is a variational autoencoder that crucially
uses a gumbel-softmax activation in order to have a approximated discrete output.

Unfortunately, I do not currently have access to the jupyter notebook containing
the bulk of my work, but as soon as I do, it will be here. A preliminary version
of the VAE model can be found in autoencoders.py
